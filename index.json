But they also tend to move to larger and better-paying establishments. This paper studies the role of establishment-size composition in explaining the city-size earnings premium. Using administrative data from Spain, we first document a strong positive correlation between city size and establishment size, measured as the number of co-workers. The establishment size for a typical worker is 33 percent larger in a city with twice the population density, even after controlling for worker fixed effects and other observable characteristics. We then decompose the city-size earnings premium into two components: the increase in earnings explained by the increase in establishment size and the within establishment-size premium. We find that 30.8 percent of the short-term gains of moving to a city twice larger can be explained by a transition to a better-paying larger establishment. In contrast, only 5.0 percent of the medium-term gains of accumulating experience in a large city can be attributed to a faster transition to larger establishments. The small contribution to the medium-term gains is due to two facts: first, in large cities establishment size only grows slightly faster than in smaller cities; second, the relationship between earnings and establishment size is weaker in larger cities. Our results indicate that the role of establishment size composition is fundamental for understanding the short-term gains of moving to a larger city but much less so for explaining the medium-term gains.","tags":null,"title":"The Role of Establishment Size in the City-Size Premium in Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrien Bilal","Damien Capelle","Charly Porcher"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"a709d756b65eb8218765ee9b7478e90d","permalink":"https://charlyporcher.github.io/publication/monopsony/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/monopsony/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Monopsony in Local Labor Markets","type":"publication"}]
