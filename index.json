How costly is information acquisition, how do these costs depend on the economic environment, how do they affect migration decisions, and ultimately, the spatial allocation of workers? To investigate these questions, I develop a quantitative dynamic model of migration with costly information acquisition and local information sharing. Agents are rationally inattentive and migration shares feature a tractable logit structure. Information frictions affect both the magnitude and the responsiveness of migration flows to variations in local opportunities. I apply the model to internal migration in Brazil and estimate it using migration flows between 137 regions. Finding where to go appears to be as costly as moving, with annualized average costs of information and migration both equal to 3% of earnings. The model successfully predicts the observed heterogeneous migration elasticities and delayed migration responses to local shocks. To illustrate its quantitative implications, I evaluate the counterfactual effect of the roll-out of broadband internet in Brazil. By allowing workers to make better mobility choices, expanding internet access increases average welfare by 1.6%, reduces migration flows by 1.2% and reduces the cross sectional dispersion in earnings by 4%.","tags":null,"title":"Migration with Costly Information - Job Market Paper","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charly Porcher","Hannah Rubinton","Clara Santamaria"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"1b7375e741e674acb9331062e7dccbc1","permalink":"https://charlyporcher.github.io/publication/prs2/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/prs2/","section":"publication","summary":"When workers move to a larger city, they tend to experience an increase in earnings. But they also tend to move to larger and better-paying establishments. This paper studies the role of establishment-size composition in explaining the city-size earnings premium. Using administrative data from Spain, we first document a strong positive correlation between city size and establishment size, measured as the number of co-workers. The establishment size for a typical worker is 33 percent larger in a city with twice the population density, even after controlling for worker fixed effects and other observable characteristics. We then decompose the city-size earnings premium into two components: the increase in earnings explained by the increase in establishment size and the within establishment-size premium. We find that 30.8 percent of the short-term gains of moving to a city twice larger can be explained by a transition to a better-paying larger establishment. In contrast, only 5.0 percent of the medium-term gains of accumulating experience in a large city can be attributed to a faster transition to larger establishments. The small contribution to the medium-term gains is due to two facts: first, in large cities establishment size only grows slightly faster than in smaller cities; second, the relationship between earnings and establishment size is weaker in larger cities. Our results indicate that the role of establishment size composition is fundamental for understanding the short-term gains of moving to a larger city but much less so for explaining the medium-term gains.","tags":null,"title":"The Role of Establishment Size in the City-Size Premium in Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Fujiwara","Eduardo Morales","Charly Porcher"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"06b128a938b4268762ac6a454f59ff6e","permalink":"https://charlyporcher.github.io/publication/fmp/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fmp/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Revealed-Preference Approach to Measuring Information Frictions in Migration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrien Bilal","Damien Capelle","Charly Porcher"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"a709d756b65eb8218765ee9b7478e90d","permalink":"https://charlyporcher.github.io/publication/monopsony/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/monopsony/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Monopsony in Local Labor Markets","type":"publication"}]
